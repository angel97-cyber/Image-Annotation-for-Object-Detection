# Image Annotation for Autonomous Vehicle Systems (Micro-Portfolio)

This project demonstrates the process of professional data annotation for object detection, a critical task for training autonomous vehicle AI.

## Project Overview

**Objective:** To accurately label a dataset of 25 real-world driving images with bounding boxes for two distinct classes: `car` and `license_plate`.

**Tools & Format:**
- **Annotation Tool:** LabelImg
- **Output Format:** YOLO (`.txt`)

This project showcases the ability to follow a clear annotation brief, maintain high standards of precision, and deliver a clean, consistent, and machine-learning-ready dataset.

## Sample Labeled Image

Here is an example of a completed annotation from the dataset:

*(We will add a screenshot here in a moment)*

## Project Structure

This repository contains two main directories:
- `/images`: Contains the 25 raw JPG images.
- `/labels`: Contains the 26 corresponding YOLO-formatted `.txt` annotation files, including the final `classes.txt`.
